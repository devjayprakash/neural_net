# neural_net

The goal for this repo is to learn neural networks. Understand the basics from scratch
and do several experiments

Goals

- [ ] Write a neural network (forward pass)
- [ ] Write the back propagation (backward pass)
- [ ] Create simple use cases (will think later on what they should be)
